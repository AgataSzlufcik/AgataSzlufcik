# Hi, I'm Agata 👋

## 🚀 About Me

I'm currently a Data Analyst Bootcamp student, building my foundations in Python and Git.

I come from a philosophy background, which shaped my analytical thinking and structured way of solving problems. Now I'm learning how to apply that mindset to data - exploring patterns, cleaning datasets and understanding how information turns into decisions.

Based in Spain 🇪🇸  
Actively learning and growing in the data field.
