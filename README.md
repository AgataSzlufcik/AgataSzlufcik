## 🚀 About Me

Hi, I'm Agata — transitioning from tourism operations to data.

With several years of experience in the travel and hospitality industry, I’ve worked closely with customers, managed real-world operational challenges and learned how important accurate information is for decision-making.

Now I’m building my skills in Data Analysis (Python, SQL, Git) to move from operational work to analytical thinking - turning real-world business questions into data-driven insights.

I’m particularly interested in Data Quality, process improvement and customer-focused analytics.


Based in Spain 🇪🇸  
Actively learning and growing in the data field.
